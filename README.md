General Approach Given By Instructors:

        1)Retrieve historical climate data http://www.worldclim.org
        2)Get a list of all species in databases (eButterfly & iNaturalist)
        3)Get lat/long data for one species from databases
        4)Extract data for one month
        5)Perform quality check (minimum # observations)
        6)Run SDM (Species Distribution Model)
                a)Any chance that future climate data could be used for future range projections?
        7)Create graphic with standardized name for use on eButterfly.org web resource
Repeat steps 4-7 for remaining months
Repeat steps 3-7 for remaining species
